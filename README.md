# Nessus-Basic-Scan

Nessus is a vulnerability scanning platform, used by people in multiple cyber security fields, including security analysts. The Nessus tool is used mostly to scan vulnerabilities. It is important to note that Nessus Professional is only accessible for 1 installation, for 7 days.
Nessus prevents network attacks by identifying vulnerabilities and other issues that may be used by hackers to penetrate a network or infrastructure.

In this task, I will configure Nessus so that I can scan the network.

After completing this exercise, you will be able to demonstrate my capabilities to:

Perform a Basic Scan
Save Reports

## Equipment, 2 virtual machines:  Windows Server 2019 - Domain Server and Windows 10 - Domain Member Workstation

Once installed, Nessus can be configured to suit your needs. The tool can be configured to suit a wide array of needs, and Nessus provides templates for a user to use as a baseline. These three are known as the discovery, compliance and vulnerability templates and can be further configured if needed.

In Windows 10 Open firefox and type: https://localhost:8834
